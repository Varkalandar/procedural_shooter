# The Harmonic Shooter

The Harmonic Shooter is a simple shoot them up game, in which all graphics and sounds are created by the program itself, no human made art is included, nor was it neccessary for any AI training, because the program doesn't use any AI, just pseudorandom numbers and some algorithms to turn these numbers into shapes, colors and sounds.

There are two levels included, with different algorithms for the background graphics. In each level enemies start easy and will gradually become tougher the farther you travel. There are some powerups, lloking like yellow, red, green and blue bubbles which you can collect to gain more bullet power, more shield power and additional guns.

Have some fun shooting procedurally generated pixel enemies with computer made explosions!
